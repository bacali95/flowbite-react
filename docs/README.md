# Flowbite React Documentation with Hugo

> **Warning** This still in WIP, we are moving the current documentation to Hugo.

## About the documentation

We are using Hugo for this documentation. If you are not familiar with the tool, the best thing that you can do is to check its official website.

The documentation `package.json` shares some dependencies with the library's `package.json` - `react`, `react-dom`, and `flowbite`.

It is important to note that it also uses the current development version of `flowbite-react`, not the latest from npm.
