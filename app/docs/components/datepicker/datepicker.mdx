The Datepicker component from Flowbite React is an advanced UI element that you can use to allow users to pick a date from a calendar view by selecting the day, month, and year values which then will be available in the input field and state of the component.

Follow the examples below to see how you can use the Datepicker component by importing it from the Flowbite React library, customize the colors and behaviour of the component by overriding the default theme variables and using the props from React.

Import the component from `flowbite-react` to use the datepicker element:

```jsx
'use client';

import { Datepicker } from 'flowbite-react';
```

## Default Datepicker

Use this example to show a simple datepicker component.

<CodePreview title="Default card">
  <Datepicker />
</CodePreview>

## Theme

To learn more about how to customize the appearance of components, please see the [Theme docs](/docs/customize/theme).

<pre className="language-tsx">
  <code>{JSON.stringify(theme.datepicker, null, 2)}</code>
</pre>
