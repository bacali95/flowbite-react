## Create project

Run the following command to create a new Remix project:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest
```

## Setup Tailwind CSS

1. Install `tailwindcss` and its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm i -D tailwindcss
```

2. Generate `tailwind.config.ts` file:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init --ts
```

3. Add the paths to all of your template files in your `tailwind.config.ts` file:

```ts {4}
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';

export default {
  content: ['./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
} satisfies Config;
```

4. Create a `./app/tailwind.css` file and add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwind's layers:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

5. Import the newly-created `./app/tailwind.css` file in your `./app/root.tsx` file:

```tsx {1,5}
import stylesheet from '~/tailwind.css';

export const links: LinksFunction = () => [
  // ...
  { rel: 'stylesheet', href: stylesheet },
];
```

## Install Flowbite React

1. Run the following command to install `flowbite-react`:

```bash
npm i flowbite-react
```

2. Add the Flowbite plugin to `tailwind.config.ts` and include content from `flowbite-react`:

```ts {1,7,11}
import flowbite from 'flowbite/plugin';
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';

export default {
  content: [
    // ...
    'node_modules/flowbite-react/lib/esm/**/*.js',
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ...
    flowbite,
  ],
} satisfies Config;
```

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library.

```tsx
import { Button } from 'flowbite-react';

export default function Index() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```

## Additional Info

To ensure smooth navigation within your application while using Remix components, it's important to align with Remix's API layer. By following these guidelines, you can optimize your navigation experience for users.

**Best Practices**

1. **Consider** `to` **instead of** `href`: When incorporating Remix components such as **`Navbar.Link`** or **`Sidebar.Item`**, keep in mind the usage of to instead of href when employing `as={Link}`. This step ensures seamless integration with Remix's API layer, maintaining consistency in navigation across your application.
2. **Leverage Remix's API Layer:** Embrace Remix's API layer for enhanced routing capabilities. Utilizing `Link` components with the `to` prop enables you to specify navigation destinations accurately.
3. **Example:**

```tsx
// Before
<Navbar.Link href="/about">About</Navbar.Link>

// After
<Navbar.Link as={Link} to="/about">About</Navbar.Link>
```

By making this simple adjustment, replacing **href** with **to** and employing `as={Link}`, you adhere to Remix's API conventions seamlessly.
