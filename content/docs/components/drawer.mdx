description: The Drawer component can be used as a hidden off-canvas sidebar for navigation and to show other information based on multiple styles and placements
---

Use the Drawer component (or "off-canvas") to show a fixed element relative to the document page from any side for navigation, contact forms, informational purposes or other user actions.

You can set multiple options such as the placement, activate body scrolling, show or hide the backdrop and even use the swipeable edge functionality to show a small part of the drawer when it is not shown completely.

Before using the popover component, make sure to import the component in your React project:

```jsx
import { Drawer } from 'flowbite-react';
```

## Default Drawer

Use this example to show a simple drawer component.

<Example name="drawer.root" />

## Placement

Use the placement options to position the drawer component either on the top, right, bottom, or left side of the document page. This can be done using the `position="{top|right|bottom|left}"` where the default value is "left".

### Left Drawer

Use this example where you can position the drawer component on the left side of the page.

<Example name="drawer.left" />

### Right Drawer

Use this example to show the drawer component on the right side of the page.

<Example name="drawer.right" />

### Top drawer

Use this example to show the drawer on the top side of the page.

<Example name="drawer.top" />

### Bottom drawer

Use this example to show the drawer on the bottom side of the page.

<Example name="drawer.bottom" />
