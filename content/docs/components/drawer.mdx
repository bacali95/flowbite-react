title: React Drawer - Flowbite
description: The Drawer component can be used as a hidden off-canvas sidebar for navigation and to show other information based on multiple styles and placements
---

Use the Drawer component (or "off-canvas") to show a fixed element relative to the document page from any side for navigation, contact forms, informational purposes or other user actions.

You can set multiple options such as the placement, activate body scrolling, show or hide the backdrop and even use the swipeable edge functionality to show a small part of the drawer when it is not shown completely.

Before using the popover component, make sure to import the component in your React project:

```jsx
import { Drawer } from 'flowbite-react';
```

## Default Drawer

Use this example to show a simple drawer component.
