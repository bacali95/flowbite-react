---

The `<Textarea>` component is a multi-line text field input that can be used to receive longer chuncks of text from the user in the form of a comment box, description field, and more.

From the examples on this page you will find multiple styles and variants of the `<Textarea>` component coded with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS including a WYSIWYG editor, comment box, chatroom textarea, all available in dark mode as well.

To start using the component make sure that you have imported it from Flowbite React:

```jsx
import { Textarea } from 'flowbite-react';
```

## Textarea example

Get started with the default example of a `<Textarea>` component below.

<Example name="textarea.example" />

## WYSIWYG Editor

If you want to add other actions as buttons alongside your `<Textarea>` component, such as with a WYSIWYG editor, then you can use the example below.

<Example name="textarea.wysiwyg" />

## Comment box

Most often the `<Textarea>` component is used as the main text field input element in comment sections. Use this example to also apply a helper text and buttons below the textarea itself.

<Example name="textarea.commentbox" />

## Chatroom input

If you want to build a chatroom component you will usually want to use a `<Textarea>` component to allow users to write multi-line chunks of text.

<Example name="textarea.chatroom" />
