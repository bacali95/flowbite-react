title: React Skeleton - Flowbite
description: The skeleton component can be used as an alternative loading indicator to the spinner by mimicking the content that will be loaded such as text, images, or video
---

Use the skeleton component to indicate a loading status with placeholder elements that look very similar to the type of content that is being loaded such as paragraphs, heading, images, videos, and more.

You can set the width and height of these skeleton components based on the size of the content and element that it is being loaded in, such as a card or an article page.

Start using the skeleton component by importing it from the `flowbite-react` library:

```jsx
import { Skeleton } from "flowbite-react";
```
