description: Use the bottom navigation bar component to allow users to navigate through your website or create a control bar using a menu that is positioned at the bottom of the page
---

The bottom bar component can be used to allow menu items and certain control actions to be performed by the user through the use of a fixed bar positioning on the bottom side of your page.

Check out multiple examples of the bottom navigation component based on various styles, controls, sizes, content and leverage the utility classes from Tailwind CSS to integrate into your own project.

## Default bottom navigation

Use the default bottom navigation bar example to show a list of menu items as buttons to allow the user to navigate through your website based on a fixed position. You can also use anchor tags instead of buttons.

<Example name="bottomNavigation.root" />

## Menu items with border

This example can be used to show a border between the menu items inside the bottom navigation bar.

<Example name="bottomNavigation.withBorder" />

## Example with Tooltip

This example can be used to show a Tooltip on the hover on the menu items.

<Example name="bottomNavigation.withTooltip" />
