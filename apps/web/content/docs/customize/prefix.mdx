title: React Theme Prefix - Flowbite
description: Learn how you can change the Tailwind CSS classes prefix used by the components in Flowbite React
---

By following these steps, you can easily customize the Tailwind CSS prefix in your Flowbite React project, ensuring better compatibility with other CSS frameworks and avoiding class name conflicts.

## Update Tailwind CSS

Provide the `prefix` property and the `flowbite-react/tailwind` plugin with a prefix value in the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js {5,8}
import flowbite from "flowbite-react/tailwind";

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  prefix: "tw-",
  plugins: [
    // ...
    flowbite({ prefix: "tw-" }),
  ],
};
```

## Update Your React Application

Next, render the `ThemeConfig` component at the **root of your app** with the `prefix` property:

```tsx {1,6}
import { ThemeConfig } from "flowbite-react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <ThemeConfig prefix="tw-" />
      {/* ... */}
    </>
  );
}
```

This ensures that all Flowbite React components use the specified prefix.
